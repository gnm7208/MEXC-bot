**Notes:** No positions; 100% cash at $32.32 baseline. No trades placed. MEXC Spot API confirmed reachable (`account`, `positions` OK; `orders` needs a symbol arg). BTC $64,063.8. 0/25 trades this week. Deployment 0% vs 75-85% target — still awaiting a qualifying setup (momentum ≥ +2% or confirmed catalyst) before first entry.

## Jul 26 — EOD Snapshot (Day 4, Sunday)

**Portfolio:** $32.29 | **Cash:** $32.29 (100%) | **Day P&L:** -$0.03 (-0.09%) | **Phase P&L:** -$0.03 (-0.09%)

|--------|-----|-------|-------|---------|----------------|------|
| — | — | — | — | — | — | — |

**Notes:** No positions; 100% cash. USDT free $32.2946 / locked $0 (canTrade=true). 0 open orders. 0 trades today, 0/25 this week. Deployment 0% vs 75-85% target — still no qualifying entry taken. Day P&L measured vs last snapshot (Jul 24 $32.32); no Jul 25 EOD snapshot was logged. Balance drift -$0.03 from baseline is dust/rounding, no fills. BTC ref $64,694.29. Research log stance: HOLD into FOMC — movers parabolic, waiting for cleaner setup.

## Jul 27 — EOD Snapshot (Day 5, Monday)

**Portfolio:** $32.29 | **Cash:** $32.29 (100%) | **Day P&L:** $0.00 (0.00%) | **Phase P&L:** -$0.03 (-0.09%)

| Ticker | Qty | Entry | Price | Day Chg | Unrealized P&L | Stop |
|--------|-----|-------|-------|---------|----------------|------|
| — | — | — | — | — | — | — |

**Notes:** No positions; 100% cash. USDT free $32.2946 / locked $0 (canTrade=true). 0 open orders. 0 trades today, 0/25 this week. Day P&L $0.00 vs Jul 26 ($32.2946, identical). Phase P&L -$0.03 vs baseline $32.32 = dust/rounding, no fills ever. BTC ref $64,622.08 (morning $65,127 → afternoon $65,054 → EOD $64,622). Deployment 0% vs 75-85% target. **Blocker unchanged (hard):** MEXC spot API has no `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT` (`orderTypes` = LIMIT/MARKET/LIMIT_MAKER) → Rule 4 protective stop unexecutable → NO TRADE all day (morning + afternoon both HALT). Research candidates AAVE +8.5% / ETH +4.1% / BANK +8.8% passed +2% gate but blocker applies regardless. FOMC Jul 28–29 binary event also argues against size. Escalated; needs a working spot-stop mechanism or a reachable venue whose API supports resting stop-limit GTC before any entry.

## 2026-07-29 — Trade Entry (Morning Execution, first-ever trade)
**BUY** ADAUSDT | Qty: 39.14 | Entry: $0.16358 | Stop: $0.1472 (−10%) | Target: $0.1751 (+7%)
**Cost:** $6.40 (19.8% of $32.29 portfolio) | **OrderId:** C02__711030883699601408046
**Thesis:** Best liquid relative-strength momentum on the board — +4.87% 24h on $4.96M MEXC vol while majors flat (+1% BTC/ETH). Clean L1 momentum entry.
**Catalyst:** None specific — pure momentum (24h ≥ +2% is a sufficient entry signal per Rule 11/buy-side gate).
**Sector:** L1.
**Stop mechanism:** Recorded −10% stop $0.1472, monitored (MEXC spot API has no resting stop-limit; midday + afternoon scans enforce −7% cut via market sell). Blocker resolved 2026-07-27, confirmed live this run.
**Notes:** First trade after 6 days at 100% cash — stop-order blocker (the standing reason for prior HOLDs) resolved; monitored stops now active per rulebook. Buy-side gate all PASS (0 positions→1, 1/25 wk, 1/5 today, size ≤20%). AAVE dropped to +0.82% (gate FAIL) and ETH +1.53% (FAIL) at execution → disqualified; ADA the only clean liquid qualifier. Single starter only — FOMC statement 2pm ET today, no broad deployment into the event.

---

## 2026-07-29 — Midday Scan

**Reachability gate PASS:** `price BTCUSDT` = $64,467.61.

**ADA position:** Entry $0.16358 → live $0.1641 (+0.32%). Stop unchanged $0.1472 (−10%). No cut (-7%), no tighten (+3%/+15%/+20%), no take-profit (+7%) triggered. Thesis (relative-strength L1 momentum) intact — no invalidating news. **No action.**

No other positions. 1/25 trades this week, 1/5 today. No closed trades → circuit breaker N/A.

---

## Jul 28 — EOD Snapshot (Day 6, Tuesday)

**Portfolio:** $32.29 | **Cash:** $32.29 (100%) | **Day P&L:** $0.00 (0.00%) | **Phase P&L:** -$0.03 (-0.08%)

| Ticker | Qty | Entry | Price | Day Chg | Unrealized P&L | Stop |
|--------|-----|-------|-------|---------|----------------|------|
| — | — | — | — | — | — | — |

**Notes:** No positions; 100% cash. USDT free $32.2946 / locked $0 (canTrade=true). 0 open orders. 0 trades today, 0/25 this week. Day P&L $0.00 vs Jul 27 ($32.2946, identical). Phase P&L -$0.03 vs baseline $32.32 = dust/rounding, no fills ever. Reachability gate PASS (BTC $63,363.32). BTC ref $63,363 (morning $63,411 → afternoon $63,496 → EOD $63,363) — grinding lower as market de-risks into FOMC. Deployment 0% vs 75-85% target. Morning + afternoon both logged NO TRADE: momentum gate failed market-wide (BTC/ETH/SOL/AAVE all red) AND the hard blocker persists — MEXC spot API has no `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT` (`orderTypes` = LIMIT/MARKET/LIMIT_MAKER; live test rejected HTTP 400) → Rule 4 protective stop unexecutable → any buy is a Rule 4 violation. FOMC statement tomorrow (Wed Jul 29, 2pm ET) argues against size regardless. Re-evaluate post-FOMC (Thu Jul 30).

---

## 2026-07-29 — Afternoon Scan

**Schedule anomaly:** routine fired at 08:11 CT (09:11 ET), not the intended 3-4 PM CT afternoon-execution slot. FOMC statement (2pm ET / 1pm CT) has **not yet been released** — ~5 hours out, hike odds ~30-38% (elevated, fastest repricing in recent memory per news). Treating this run as a monitoring-only pass, consistent with this morning's "single starter only, no additional entries into the event" stance.

**Reachability gate PASS:** `price ADAUSDT` = $0.1639.

**ADA position:** Entry $0.16358 → live $0.1639 (+0.20%). No stop order exists on-exchange (MEXC has no STOP_LOSS_LIMIT; stop is monitored/virtual at $0.1472 per TRADE-LOG). No cut (-7%), no tighten (+3%), no take-profit (+7%) triggered. Thesis intact. **No action.**

**Gates:** 0 closed trades this week → circuit breaker N/A. 1 trade today → daily gate N/A (needs ≥3).

**Watchlist re-check (live 24h %, corrected for MEXC's decimal-fraction field):** ADA +3.73% (held), XRP +2.18% (vol $19M, gate PASS — CLARITY Act Senate vote + Ripple EU CASP license catalysts), AAVE -0.15% (FAIL), ETH +0.66% (FAIL), SOL +0.34% (FAIL), BTC +1.23% (FAIL), BNB +0.16% (FAIL).

**Decision: NO NEW ENTRY.** XRP clears the +2% momentum gate, but FOMC statement is a pending binary event (~30-38% hike odds, well above typical pre-meeting levels) 5 hours out — opening a new position ahead of it contradicts this morning's explicit "no additional entries into the event" call and general prudence around binary-event risk. Staying at 1 open position (ADA), $25.89 USDT dry powder. Re-evaluate for a genuine afternoon session (post-FOMC, ~3-4 PM CT) if the routine fires again today.

## Jul 29 — EOD Snapshot (Day 7, Wednesday)

**Portfolio:** $32.27 | **Cash:** $25.89 (80.2%) | **Day P&L:** -$0.03 (-0.08%) | **Phase P&L:** -$0.05 (-0.16%)

| Ticker | Qty   | Entry     | Price    | Day Chg | Unrealized P&L    | Stop     |
|--------|-------|-----------|----------|---------|-------------------|----------|
| ADA    | 39.14 | $0.16358  | $0.1629  | -0.42%  | -$0.03 (-0.42%)   | $0.1472  |

**Notes:** First position live — ADA (39.14 @ $0.16358, entered this morning). Reachability gate PASS (BTC $64,167.23, ADA $0.1629). USDT free $25.8920 / locked $0. 1 trade today, 1/25 this week; 0 closed trades → circuit breaker N/A, daily gate N/A. Deployment 19.8% vs 75-85% target — single starter only, held size small through FOMC. ADA -0.42% vs entry, well above the -7% cut and the $0.1472 monitored stop; no tighten (needs +3%), no take-profit (needs +7%). Thesis (relative-strength L1 momentum) intact. Day P&L -$0.03 = ADA drift only (yesterday $32.2946 all-cash → today $32.2680). Phase P&L -$0.05 vs $32.32 baseline. FOMC statement released 2pm ET today; BTC $63,363 (Jul 28 EOD) → $64,167 now (+1.3%), no risk-off shock — market absorbed the event. Post-FOMC re-eval Thu Jul 30 for broader deployment (XRP watchlist candidate cleared +2% gate pre-event; re-check momentum tomorrow).

## 2026-07-30 — Midday Scan

**Reachability gate PASS:** `price BTCUSDT` = $64,569.99.

**ADA position:** Entry $0.16358 → live $0.164 (+0.26%). Stop unchanged $0.1472 (−10%). No cut (-7%), no tighten (+3%/+15%/+20%), no take-profit (+7%) triggered. Thesis (relative-strength L1 momentum) softened but not broken — no invalidating news since morning-execution. **No action.**

No other positions. 1/25 trades this week, 0/5 today. No closed trades → circuit breaker N/A.

---

## 2026-07-30 — Afternoon Scan

**Reachability gate PASS:** `price ADAUSDT` = $0.1659.

**ADA position:** Entry $0.16358 → live $0.1659 (+1.42%). Stop unchanged $0.1472 (−10%). No cut (-7%), no tighten (+3%), no take-profit (+7%) triggered. Thesis (relative-strength L1 momentum) intact. **No action.**

**Gates:** 0 closed trades this week → circuit breaker N/A. 0 trades today → daily gate N/A.

**Watchlist re-check (live 24h %, MEXC 24hr ticker):**
- **SUI** +0.61% (vol $0.67M) — FAIL, below gate and illiquid.
- **XMR** +2.98% (vol $2.13M) — clears +2% gate but volume down from this morning's $3.2M (declining, not confirmed) and no fresh catalyst (news check: persistent bearish trend, −60% off Jan peak, only long-horizon items — THORChain integration Q3, FCMP++ upgrade 2026-27). Reads as a fade bounce, not a volume-confirmed continuation per morning research's own caveat. **Disqualified — quality filter.**
- **BNB** +2.96% (vol $13.9M) — clears gate with strong liquidity but not on today's watchlist and no fresh same-day catalyst (token burn Jul 17, T. Rowe ETF Jul 16 — both stale/priced in; active EU MiCA authorization miss + UK lawsuit are headwinds, not tailwinds). **Disqualified — no watchlist hit, no clear new catalyst.**

**Decision: NO NEW ENTRY.** No liquid mover clears both the momentum gate and the watchlist-or-catalyst requirement with real conviction. Hold ADA (+1.42%, healthy), $25.89 (80%) dry powder. Re-evaluate at daily-summary / next session.

## Jul 30 — EOD Snapshot (Day 8, Thursday)

**Portfolio:** $32.73 | **Cash:** $25.89 (79.1%) | **Day P&L:** +$0.47 (+1.44%) | **Phase P&L:** +$0.41 (+1.28%)

| Ticker | Qty   | Entry    | Price   | Day Chg | Unrealized P&L   | Stop     |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|---------|------------------|----------|
| ADA    | 39.14 | $0.16358 | $0.1748 | +7.3%   | +$0.44 (+6.86%)  | $0.1626  |

**Notes:** ADA rallied hard into the close — $0.1659 (afternoon scan) → $0.1748 now (+6.86% from entry, one tick under the +7% take-profit target of $0.1751; bid $0.1750 = +6.98% realizable). **Trailing stop tightened per Rule 7:** position past +3% gain → stop moved $0.1472 → $0.1626 (7% below current $0.1748), locking a floor near breakeven and protecting the run-up; never moved down, 7% clearance vs current. **Take-profit NOT yet triggered** (last $0.1748 < target $0.1751) — flagged for next execution scan: sell at market the instant ADA prints ≥ $0.1751 (+7%), no exceptions. Reachability gate PASS (BTC $64,733; ADA $0.1748). USDT free $25.8920 / locked $0 (canTrade=true). 0 open orders. 0 trades today, 1/25 this week; 0 closed trades → circuit breaker N/A, daily gate N/A. Deployment 20.9% ($6.84 ADA) vs 75-85% target — single position, dry powder held. Day P&L +$0.47 = ADA appreciation (Jul 29 EOD $32.2680 → $32.7337). Phase P&L flips positive: +$0.41 (+1.28%) vs $32.32 baseline — first green phase print, driven entirely by the ADA momentum entry. BTC $63,363 (Jul 28) → $64,167 (Jul 29) → $64,733 now, grinding up post-FOMC; ADA outperforming majors (+7.3% day vs BTC ~flat), relative-strength L1 thesis validated.


## 2026-07-31 — Midday Scan

**Reachability gate PASS:** `price BTCUSDT` = $63,954.81.

**ADA position:** Entry $0.16358 → live $0.1707 (+4.35%). Stop unchanged $0.1626 (set EOD Jul 30, 7% below that day's peak $0.1748; 7% below today's current $0.1707 = $0.1588, lower than existing stop → never move a stop down, kept $0.1626). No cut (-7% = $0.1521), no tighten (already past +3% and stop already tighter than the 7%-below-current floor), no take-profit (+7% = $0.1751) triggered. Thesis (relative-strength L1 momentum + Voltaire decentralization catalyst) intact — no invalidating news. **No action.**

No other positions. 1/25 trades this week, 0/5 today. No closed trades → circuit breaker N/A.

## 2026-07-31 — Afternoon Scan

**Reachability gate PASS:** `price BTCUSDT` = $63,748.75.

**ADA position:** Entry $0.16358 → live $0.1698 (+3.80%). Stop unchanged $0.1626 (set EOD Jul 30; 7% below current $0.1698 = $0.1579, lower than existing stop → never move a stop down, kept $0.1626). No cut (-7% = $0.1521), no additional tighten needed, no take-profit (+7% = $0.1751) triggered. Thesis (relative-strength L1 momentum + Voltaire decentralization catalyst) intact. **No action.**

**Gates:** 0 closed trades this week → circuit breaker N/A. 0 trades today → daily gate N/A.

**Watchlist re-check (live 24h %, MEXC 24hr ticker, corrected decimal-fraction field):**
- BNB +1.31% (vol $16.2M) — below +2% gate, FAIL.
- XRP -0.82%, BTC -1.73%, ETH -2.17%, SOL -0.87% — all red, FAIL.
- Perplexity unavailable (key not set) → WebSearch fallback for afternoon catalysts surfaced UNI +3.74% (vol $0.52M), ENA +2.10% (vol $0.55M), PUMP +5.14% (vol $0.26M), NEAR +0.81%, ONDO -4.21% — none on today's watchlist, all thin liquidity (<$1M, well below the ~$3M liquid-book threshold used all week) or negative. **All disqualified — liquidity/quality filter.**

**Decision: NO NEW ENTRY.** No liquid mover clears the +2% momentum gate with real volume and a watchlist hit or fresh catalyst. Hold ADA (+3.80%, healthy, stop $0.1626), $25.89 (79.5%) dry powder. Re-evaluate at daily-summary.

## 2026-08-01 — Midday Scan

**Reachability gate PASS:** `price BTCUSDT` = $63,042.57.

**ADA position:** Entry $0.16358 → live $0.1732 (+5.88%). Stop unchanged $0.1626 (set EOD Jul 30, 7% below that day's $0.1748 peak; 7% below today's current $0.1732 = $0.1611, lower than existing stop → never move a stop down, kept $0.1626). No cut (-7% = $0.1521), no take-profit (+7% = $0.1751) triggered. Not yet at +15%/+20% tighten thresholds. Thesis (relative-strength L1 momentum + Voltaire decentralization catalyst) intact — no invalidating news. **No action.**

No other positions (1 total: ADA). 1/25 trades this week, 0/5 today. No closed trades → circuit breaker N/A.

## Jul 31 — EOD Snapshot (Day 9, Friday)

**Portfolio:** $32.47 | **Cash:** $25.89 (79.7%) | **Day P&L:** -$0.27 (-0.81%) | **Phase P&L:** +$0.15 (+0.46%)

| Ticker | Qty   | Entry    | Price   | Day Chg | Unrealized P&L   | Stop     |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|---------|------------------|----------|
| ADA    | 39.14 | $0.16358 | $0.168  | -3.89%  | +$0.17 (+2.70%)  | $0.1626  |

**Notes:** ADA gave back part of yesterday's spike — Jul 30 EOD $0.1748 → $0.168 now (-3.89% on the day), still +2.70% above entry and well clear of the -7% cut ($0.1521) and monitored stop $0.1626. Bid $0.1676 realizable. **Stop unchanged $0.1626** (set Jul 30, 7% below that day's $0.1748 peak): +2.70% gain is under the +3% trailing trigger, and 7%-below-current ($0.1562) is lower than the existing stop → never move a stop down. **Take-profit NOT triggered** (last $0.168 < target $0.1751) — TP flag stays live for next scan: sell at market the instant ADA prints ≥ $0.1751 (+7%). Reachability gate PASS (BTC $62,621; ADA $0.168). USDT free $25.8920 / locked $0 (canTrade=true). 0 open orders. 0 trades today, 1/25 this week; 0 closed trades → circuit breaker N/A, daily gate N/A. Deployment 20.3% ($6.58 ADA) vs 75-85% target — single position held small, dry powder preserved through Extreme-Fear tape (F&G 25). Day P&L -$0.27 = ADA pullback (Jul 30 EOD $32.7337 → today $32.4675). Phase P&L +$0.15 (+0.46%) vs $32.32 baseline — still green but narrower than yesterday's +$0.41. BTC $64,733 (Jul 30) → $62,621 now (-3.3%), risk-off grind lower; ADA outperformed majors on the day (-3.89% vs BTC -3.3% roughly matched, but held above entry). Thesis (relative-strength L1 momentum + Voltaire decentralization catalyst) intact; watchlist showed no liquid qualifier all day.

## 2026-08-01 — Trade Exit (afternoon take-profit)
**SELL** ADAUSDT | Qty: 39.14 | Exit: $0.17502 (avg, market) | Entry: $0.16358 | Realized P&L: +$0.45 (+7.0%) | Reason: +7% take-profit rule
**OrderId:** C02__712224387847139328046
**Notes:** Live price at scan $0.1752 (+7.10% vs entry) tripped the +7% target ($0.1751) first time all week. No on-exchange stop to cancel (virtual/monitored only, 0 open orders confirmed). Closed via `mexc.sh close ADAUSDT`. USDT free $25.8920 → $32.7420 (proceeds $6.8500 vs $6.40 cost basis). Portfolio now 100% cash, 0 open positions. 2/25 trades this week, 1/5 today (1 win, 0 losses → daily win rate 100%). Thesis (relative-strength L1 momentum + Voltaire catalyst) played out exactly as planned — full cycle from Jul 29 entry to Aug 1 target.

---

## 2026-08-01 — Afternoon Scan

**Reachability gate PASS:** `price BTCUSDT` = $63,109.28.

**Take-profit executed this run:** ADA closed at +7.0% (see Trade Exit above). Portfolio now 100% cash ($32.7420), 0 open positions.

**Gates:** 1 closed trade this week (win) → circuit breaker N/A (needs ≥5 closed). 1 trade today (the ADA exit, a win) → daily gate N/A (needs ≥3).

**Watchlist re-check (live 24h %, MEXC 24hr ticker, corrected decimal-fraction field):**
- ADA +3.11% (vol $3.46M) — clears +2% gate but this is the position just exited at the +7% target; no fresh same-day catalyst (Cardano Catalyst Pilot Fund is a scheduled governance item, not a price catalyst). **Disqualified — no chasing a just-closed take-profit without a fresh reason.**
- XMR +3.13% (vol $3.37M) — clears gate on liquidity but same fade-bounce profile disqualified all week; news check found **negative** regulatory catalysts (Philippines delisting ban, EU AMLR anonymity-coin restrictions), no positive trigger. **Disqualified — quality filter, worse than before.**
- BNB -2.63%, BTC -1.0%, ETH -0.8%, SOL -0.99%, XRP -0.79% — all red. **FAIL momentum.**
- Perplexity unavailable (key not set) → WebSearch fallback used for catalyst check.

**Decision: NO NEW ENTRY.** Locked in the first realized win of the phase (ADA +7.0%); no liquid mover clears both the momentum gate and a genuine catalyst/quality bar this session. Holding 100% cash ($32.7420, 79.7%→100%) as dry powder. Re-evaluate at daily-summary / next session.

## 2026-08-02 — Trade Entry (Morning Execution, ADA re-entry — ETF catalyst)
**BUY** ADAUSDT | Qty: 35.1 | Entry: $0.18639 | Stop: $0.1678 (−10%) | Target: $0.1994 (+7%)
**Cost:** $6.5424 (19.98% of $32.74 portfolio) | **OrderId:** C02__712479924023111682046
**Thesis:** Fresh L1 re-entry on a confirmed breakout above the $0.1809 pivot (last $0.186, near session high $0.1866). +9.09% 24h on $6.13M MEXC vol — best liquid relative-strength mover on the board while majors flat (BTC +0.55%). Distinct from the prior Voltaire trade closed Aug 1.
**Catalyst:** Aug-9 SEC spot-ADA-ETF eligibility milestone (CME ADA futures complete mandatory 6-month history → meets SEC review criterion; Grayscale/VanEck/21Shares/Canary filings pending, decision window to Oct 23) + ADA whales ~70% of circulating supply (accumulation) + descending-trendline breakout.
**Sector:** L1.
**Stop mechanism:** Recorded −10% stop $0.1678, monitored (MEXC spot API has no resting stop-limit; midday + afternoon scans enforce −7% cut $0.1733 via market sell). Confirmed live: 0 open orders on-exchange.
**Notes:** Buy-side gate all PASS (0 positions→1, 2/25 wk→3/25, 0/5 today→1/5, size ≤20%, momentum +9.09% ≥ +2%, catalyst documented). Required confirmed close ≥ $0.1809 before entry — satisfied (price holding $0.186 above pivot, not a failed wick). Actual fill $0.18639 ~2.9% above research's modeled $0.180 entry (bought the confirmation, per plan). Remaining $26.20 USDT (80%) dry powder — single starter into a weekend Fear tape (F&G 27), no additional entries. ClickUp alerted (trade fired). Midday scan to enforce stop / manage.
**Peak P&L:** +5.16% @ $0.1959 (2026-08-04) — trailing stop tightened to $0.1822 at this level

| — (100% cash) | — | — | — | — | — | — |

**Notes:** No open positions — first realized win of the phase booked today. ADA closed at +7.0% take-profit ($0.16358 → $0.17502 avg, +$0.45 realized) when live price tripped the $0.1751 target for the first time all week (full cycle Jul 29 entry → Aug 1 target, relative-strength L1 momentum + Voltaire catalyst thesis played out exactly). Portfolio 100% cash: USDT free $32.7420 / locked $0 (canTrade=true). 0 open orders, 0 positions. Reachability gate PASS (BTC $63,129). **Trades:** 1 today (the ADA exit, a win → daily win rate 100%), 2/25 this week; 1 closed trade this week (1W/0L) → circuit breaker N/A (needs ≥5 closed), daily gate N/A (needs ≥5 trades). Day P&L +$0.27 = ADA appreciation from Jul 31 EOD $6.575 value → $6.85 realized proceeds (portfolio $32.4675 → $32.7420). Phase P&L +$0.42 (+1.31%) vs $32.32 baseline — new phase high, up from Jul 31's +$0.15. BTC $62,621 (Jul 31) → $63,129 now (+0.8%), stabilizing after the risk-off grind; F&G still Extreme Fear zone. Deployment 0% vs 75-85% target — fully in cash post-exit; watchlist showed no liquid mover clearing both the +2% momentum gate and a quality catalyst at the afternoon scan (ADA can't be chased post-TP, XMR negative regulatory news, majors all red). Dry powder preserved for a clean re-entry when a qualifying setup appears. **BTC buy-and-hold benchmark:** phase baseline entry BTC ~$63,500 area (Jul 22 funding) — bot +1.31% vs roughly flat/slightly negative BTC over the window; outperforming buy-and-hold.

## 2026-08-02 — Midday Scan

**Reachability gate PASS:** `price BTCUSDT` = $63,180.68.

**ADA position:** Entry $0.18639 → live $0.1866 (+0.11%). Stop unchanged $0.1678 (−10%, set at fill this morning). No cut (-7% = $0.1733), no tighten (+3% trigger not reached, gain only +0.11%), no take-profit (+7% = $0.1994) triggered. Thesis (Aug-9 SEC spot-ADA-ETF eligibility milestone + whale accumulation + trendline breakout) intact — no invalidating news, price move too small (<5%) to warrant intraday research check. **No action.**

No other positions (1 total: ADA). 3/25 trades this week, 1/5 today. No closed trades this week → circuit breaker N/A.

## 2026-08-02 — Afternoon Scan

**Reachability gate PASS:** `price BTCUSDT` = $63,112.89.

**ADA position:** Entry $0.18639 → live $0.1902 (+2.04%). Stop unchanged $0.1678 (−10%, set at fill this morning). No cut (-7% = $0.1733), no tighten (+3% trigger not reached, gain +2.04%), no take-profit (+7% = $0.1994) triggered. Thesis (Aug-9 SEC spot-ADA-ETF eligibility milestone + whale accumulation + trendline breakout) intact — no invalidating news. **No action.**

No other positions (1 total: ADA). Note: `openOrders` endpoint returned `{"code":700007,"msg":"No permission to access the endpoint."}` (API key permission gap, not a connectivity failure — `account`/`positions`/`price` all healthy). Not a blocker: USDT and ADA balances both show `locked: 0`, confirming no resting on-exchange orders exist (consistent with the rulebook's virtual/monitored-stop mechanism, not on-exchange stop-limit orders).

**Gates:** 0 closed trades this week → circuit breaker N/A (needs ≥5). 1 trade today → daily gate N/A (needs ≥3).

**Watchlist re-check (live 24h %, MEXC 24hr ticker, decimal-fraction field):**
- ADA +8.62% (vol $8.07M) — clears gate but this is the held position, already at 20% cap; not a new-entry candidate.
- BNB +0.55% (vol $11.23M) — below +2% gate. **FAIL.**
- LINK +2.29% (vol $0.45M) — clears momentum gate but volume well below the ~$3M liquid threshold used all week, and the only "catalyst" found (Chainlink/Dept. of Commerce on-chain GDP data) is a generic monthly-outlook mention, not a same-day trigger. **Disqualified — liquidity/quality filter.**
- TAO -0.66%, SUI +0.43%, HYPE -1.26% — all fail momentum gate.
- Perplexity unavailable (key not set) → WebSearch fallback for afternoon catalysts surfaced only generic "best altcoins for August" listicle content, nothing ticker-specific or same-day.

**Decision: NO NEW ENTRY.** Hold ADA (+2.04%, healthy, stop $0.1678), $26.20 (80%) dry powder. Re-evaluate at daily-summary.

Bid $0.1895 realizable. **Stop unchanged $0.1678** (-10%, set at fill): +1.72% gain is under the +3% trailing trigger; no tighten. **Take-profit NOT triggered** (last $0.1896 < target $0.1994, +7%) — TP flag stays live: sell at market the instant ADA prints ≥ $0.1994. Reachability gate PASS (BTC $63,104; ADA $0.1896). USDT free $26.1996 / locked $0 (canTrade=true). 0 open orders (openOrders endpoint returns code 700007 permission gap, but USDT+ADA both locked=0 confirms no resting orders — consistent with virtual/monitored stops). **Trades:** 1 today (ADA re-buy), 3/25 this week; 1 closed trade this week (1W/0L) → circuit breaker N/A (needs ≥5 closed), daily gate N/A (needs ≥5 trades). Day P&L +$0.11 = ADA intraday appreciation since entry (Aug 1 EOD $32.7420 all-cash → $6.5424 deployed to ADA, now worth $6.655). Phase P&L +$0.53 (+1.65%) vs $32.32 baseline — new phase high (up from Aug 1's +$0.42). ADA 24h +9.46% ($9.3M vol), best liquid relative-strength mover, outperforming majors (BTC $63,129 Aug 1 → $63,104 now, flat) — L1 momentum + ETF-eligibility thesis intact. Deployment 20.3% ($6.655 ADA) vs 75-85% target — single starter into weekend Fear tape (F&G 27), dry powder held. **BTC buy-and-hold benchmark:** bot +1.65% phase vs roughly flat BTC over the window — outperforming.

No cut (-7% = $0.1733), no tighten (+3% trigger not reached, gain ~flat), no take-profit (+7% = $0.1994) triggered. Thesis (Aug-9 SEC spot-ADA-ETF eligibility milestone + whale accumulation + trendline breakout) intact — no invalidating news, price move negligible (<5%), no intraday research check warranted. **No action.**

No other positions (1 total: ADA). `openOrders` still returns permission-gap error (code 700007); USDT+ADA both `locked: 0` confirms no resting orders. 3/25 trades this week, 0/5 today. 1 closed trade this week (1W/0L) → circuit breaker N/A (needs ≥5 closed).

**Decision: NO NEW ENTRY.** No liquid mover clears both the momentum gate and a genuine liquidity/catalyst bar this session — consistent with the morning and midday scans (0 qualifiers all day). Hold ADA (+2.10%, healthy, stop $0.1678), $26.20 (80%) dry powder. Re-evaluate at daily-summary.

**Notes:** ADA continues to grind higher — afternoon $0.1903 → EOD $0.1918 (bid $0.1916 realizable), now +2.90% above entry, well clear of the -7% cut ($0.1733) and monitored stop $0.1678. **Stop unchanged $0.1678** (-10%, set at fill 2026-08-02): +2.90% gain is still just under the +3% trailing trigger; no tighten this scan (watch for a +3% print → tighten to 7% below current). **Take-profit NOT triggered** (last $0.1918 < target $0.1994, +7%) — TP flag stays live: sell at market the instant ADA prints ≥ $0.1994. Reachability gate PASS (BTC $63,894; ADA $0.1918). USDT free $26.1996 / locked $0 (canTrade=true). 0 open orders (`orders`/`openOrders` endpoint returns permission-gap error code 700007, but USDT+ADA both locked=0 confirms no resting orders — consistent with virtual/monitored stops). **Trades:** 0 today, 3/25 this week; 1 closed trade this week (1W/0L) → circuit breaker N/A (needs ≥5 closed), daily gate N/A (needs ≥5 trades). Day P&L +$0.08 = ADA intraday appreciation only (35.1 × ($0.1918−$0.1896) = +$0.077; USDT unchanged). Phase P&L +$0.61 (+1.89%) vs $32.32 baseline — new phase high (up from Aug 2's +$0.53). ADA 24h +1.31% ($7.45M vol), best liquid relative-strength L1 mover on the day vs a flat/soft majors tape (BTC $63,104 Aug 2 EOD → $63,894 now, +1.3%) — Aug-9 SEC spot-ADA-ETF eligibility milestone + whale-accumulation + trendline-breakout thesis intact, no invalidating news. Deployment 20.4% ($6.732 ADA) vs 75-85% target — single starter held through Fear tape; 0 watchlist qualifiers cleared both the +2% momentum gate and the liquidity/catalyst bar across all three scans today, so dry powder ($26.20) preserved for a clean re-entry. **BTC buy-and-hold benchmark:** phase baseline BTC ~$63,500 (Jul 22 funding) → $63,894 now (~+0.6%); bot +1.89% phase — outperforming buy-and-hold.

## 2026-08-04 — Morning Execution (Day 13, Tuesday)

**Reachability gate PASS:** `price BTCUSDT` = $63,846.73.

**Buy-side: NO NEW TRADE.** Momentum gate (24h ≥ +2%) re-confirmed live and FAILS market-wide for every fresh liquid name — BNB +1.22% ($10.0M vol), SOL +1.13%, ETH +0.22%, XRP +0.35%, DOGE +0.70%, LINK −1.01% (thin $0.27M). ADA +6.12% ($9.95M vol) is the **only** liquid +2% mover but it is the held position already at the 20% cap → not a new-entry candidate. No trade idea passes the buy-side gate (research idea #1 = no fresh entry; #3 BNB below gate, no catalyst; #4 hold dry powder). Buy-side portfolio/daily/weekly gates otherwise all PASS (1 position, 3/25 wk, 0/5 today). No ClickUp alert (no trade fired).

**ADA position — trailing tighten EXECUTED.** Entry $0.18639 → live $0.1959 (bid $0.1961/ask $0.1962), **+5.16%** — gain has cleared the +3% trailing-tighten trigger for the first time. **Stop raised $0.1678 → $0.1822** (7% below current $0.1959, locks profit above entry; higher than prior stop so no down-move; 7% clearance satisfies the "never tighten within 3% of current" rule). Monitored/virtual stop (MEXC spot API has no resting stop-limit; USDT+ADA both locked=0 confirms no on-exchange orders) — midday/afternoon scans enforce. **Take-profit NOT triggered** (last $0.1959 < target $0.1994, +7%; day high tagged $0.1994 exactly but current below) — TP flag live: sell at market the instant ADA prints ≥ $0.1994. Thesis (Aug-9 SEC spot-ADA-ETF eligibility milestone + ~70% whale accumulation + trendline breakout) intact, no invalidating news.

**Gates:** 3/25 trades this week, 0/5 today. 1 closed trade this week (1W/0L) → circuit breaker N/A (needs ≥5 closed), daily gate N/A. Holding $26.20 (79%) dry powder into Fri Aug-7 NFP event risk.

No cut (-7% = $0.1733), no take-profit (+7% = $0.1994) triggered. No further tighten: current +4.46% is below this morning's +5.16% high — retightening to 7% below $0.1947 ($0.1811) would move the stop down, which is prohibited; existing $0.1822 stop stands. Thesis (Aug-9 SEC spot-ADA-ETF eligibility milestone + ~70% whale accumulation + trendline breakout, 5 days out) intact — no invalidating news, price move <5% since morning, no intraday research check warranted. **No action.**

No cut (-7% = $0.1733), no take-profit (+7% = $0.1994) triggered. No further tighten: current +4.73% is below this morning's +5.16% high — retightening to 7% below $0.1952 ($0.1815) would move the stop down, which is prohibited; existing $0.1822 stop stands.

**Decision: NO NEW ENTRY.** No liquid mover clears both the momentum gate and a genuine same-day catalyst this session. Hold ADA (+4.73%, healthy, stop $0.1822), $26.20 (79%) dry powder. Re-evaluate at daily-summary.

Stop unchanged $0.1822 (tightened Aug 4 to 7% below that day's $0.1959 high): current gain +2.31% is below the Aug-4 high, so retightening to 7% below live ($0.1774) would move the stop DOWN — prohibited; $0.1822 stands (locks profit above the $0.18639 entry).

**Notes:** ADA gave back the intraday high — morning tagged $0.1959 (+5.16%), afternoon $0.1952, EOD $0.1927 (bid $0.1926 realizable), now +3.39% above entry, still well clear of the -7% cut ($0.1733) and monitored stop $0.1822. **Stop unchanged $0.1822** (tightened this morning to 7% below the $0.1959 print that first cleared the +3% trigger): current +3.39% is below the morning high, so retightening to 7% below $0.1927 ($0.1792) would move the stop down — prohibited; existing $0.1822 stands (locks profit above $0.18639 entry). **Take-profit NOT triggered** (last $0.1927 < target $0.1994, +7%) — TP flag stays live: sell at market the instant ADA prints ≥ $0.1994. Reachability gate PASS (BTC $64,003.65; ADA $0.1927). USDT free $26.1996 / locked $0 (canTrade), ADA 35.1 free / locked $0 — both locked=0 confirms no resting orders (virtual/monitored stop; MEXC spot has no stop-limit). **Trades:** 0 today, 3/25 this week; 1 closed trade this week (1W/0L) → circuit breaker N/A (needs ≥5 closed), daily gate N/A (0 trades today). Day P&L +$0.03 = ADA intraday drift only ($0.1918 → $0.1927; 35.1 × $0.0009 = +$0.032; USDT unchanged). Phase P&L +$0.64 (+1.99%) vs $32.32 baseline — new phase high (up from Aug 3's +$0.61). Deployment 20.5% ($6.76 ADA) vs 75-85% target — single ADA starter held through a soft Fear tape; momentum cooled market-wide across all three scans (BNB, SOL, ETH, XRP, DOGE, LINK all failed the +2% gate at afternoon), so 0 fresh qualifiers cleared both the momentum gate and the liquidity/catalyst bar → dry powder ($26.20) preserved for a clean re-entry, and into Fri Aug-7 NFP event risk. ADA thesis (Aug-9 SEC spot-ADA-ETF eligibility milestone + ~70% whale accumulation + trendline breakout, 5 days out) intact — no invalidating news. **BTC buy-and-hold benchmark:** phase baseline BTC ~$63,500 (Jul 22 funding) → $64,003.65 now (~+0.79%); bot +1.99% phase — outperforming buy-and-hold.

**Decision: NO ACTION.** Stop unchanged $0.1822. No ClickUp alert (no action taken).

## 2026-08-05 — Afternoon Execution (Day 14, Wednesday)

**Reachability gate PASS:** `price BTCUSDT` = $64,613.37.

**ADA position:** Entry $0.18639 → live bid $0.1913/ask $0.1915 (last $0.1916), **+2.63%** (bid-basis). No cut (-7% = $0.1733, not close). No take-profit (+7% = $0.1994, not close). No tighten: +2.63% is below the +3% trailing trigger (and below the Aug-4 $0.1959 high that set the existing $0.1822 stop — retightening would move it down, prohibited). Thesis (Aug-9 SEC spot-ADA-ETF eligibility milestone, 4 days out + ~70% whale accumulation + trendline breakout) intact — no invalidating news. **No action.**

No other positions (1 total: ADA). `orders` endpoint still returns HTTP 400 (permission gap, code 700007 pattern); USDT+ADA both `locked: 0` confirms no resting orders. 3/25 trades this week, 0/5 today. 1 closed trade this week (1W/0L) → circuit breaker N/A (needs ≥5 closed), daily gate N/A (0 trades today).

**Watchlist re-check (today's RESEARCH-LOG watchlist ticker):**
- BNB $601.88, **+0.0145%** (vol $13.3M) — flat, well below the +2% gate and below the $605 reclaim trigger set this morning. **FAIL.**
- Perplexity key unset → WebSearch fallback for afternoon catalysts surfaced only generic "best altcoins for August 2026" listicle content (Chainlink, Solana, Hyperliquid, Sui, Stellar mentions) — nothing same-day or ticker-specific.

**Decision: NO NEW ENTRY.** BNB (the only watchlist name) is flat and fails the gate; no fresh catalyst found. Hold ADA (+2.63%, healthy, stop $0.1822), $26.20 (79%) dry powder. No ClickUp alert (no trade fired). Re-evaluate at daily-summary.

## Aug 5 — EOD Snapshot (Day 14, Wednesday)

**Portfolio:** $32.92 | **Cash:** $26.20 (79.6%) | **Day P&L:** −$0.05 (−0.14%) | **Phase P&L:** +$0.60 (+1.85%)

| Ticker | Qty  | Entry    | Price   | Day Chg | Unrealized P&L  | Stop     |
|--------|------|----------|---------|---------|-----------------|----------|
| ADA    | 35.1 | $0.18639 | $0.1914 | −0.72%  | +$0.18 (+2.69%) | $0.1822  |

**Notes:** ADA drifted lower on the day — Aug-4 EOD $0.1927 → today $0.1914 (bid $0.1913 realizable), 24h −0.72% (day high $0.1989, low $0.1899), now +2.69% above entry, still well clear of the −7% cut ($0.1733) and monitored stop $0.1822. **Stop unchanged $0.1822** (tightened Aug 4 to 7% below the $0.1959 print that first cleared the +3% trigger): current +2.69% is below that Aug-4 high, so retightening to 7% below $0.1914 ($0.1780) would move the stop DOWN — prohibited; existing $0.1822 stands (locks profit above the $0.18639 entry). **Take-profit NOT triggered** (last $0.1914 < +7% flag $0.1994, target +12% = $0.2088) — TP flag stays live: sell at market the instant ADA prints ≥ $0.2088. Reachability gate PASS (BTC $64,509.41; ADA $0.1914). USDT free $26.1996 / locked $0 (canTrade), ADA 35.1 free / locked $0 — both locked=0 confirms no resting orders (virtual/monitored stop; MEXC spot has no stop-limit). **Trades:** 0 today, 3/25 this week; 1 closed trade this week (1W/0L) → circuit breaker N/A (needs ≥5 closed), daily gate N/A (0 trades today). Day P&L −$0.05 = ADA intraday drift only (35.1 × ($0.1914 − $0.1927) = −$0.046; USDT unchanged). Phase P&L +$0.60 (+1.85%) vs $32.32 baseline — off Aug-4's +$0.64 high on the ADA give-back. Deployment 20.4% ($6.72 ADA) vs 75-85% target — single ADA starter held through a flat/soft Fear tape; momentum cooled market-wide all three scans today (only new-listing/microcap pumps cleared +2%, no liquid tradeable name qualified), so 0 fresh qualifiers cleared both the momentum gate and the liquidity/catalyst bar → dry powder ($26.20) preserved for a clean re-entry, and into Fri Aug-7 NFP event risk. ADA thesis (Aug-9 SEC spot-ADA-ETF eligibility milestone, **4 days out** + ~70% whale accumulation + trendline breakout) intact — no invalidating news. **BTC buy-and-hold benchmark:** phase baseline BTC ~$63,500 (Jul 22 funding) → $64,509.41 now (~+1.59%); bot +1.85% phase — still outperforming buy-and-hold.

## 2026-08-05 — Afternoon Execution Re-Check (Ad Hoc, post-EOD)

**Reachability gate PASS:** `price BTCUSDT` = $64,911.88.

**ADA position:** Entry $0.18639 → live bid $0.1898/ask $0.1899, **+1.83%** (bid-basis). No cut (−7% = $0.1733, not close). No take-profit (+7% flag $0.1994 / +12% target $0.2088, not close). No tighten: +1.83% below the +3% trailing trigger and below the Aug-4 $0.1959 high that set the existing $0.1822 stop — retightening would move it down, prohibited. Thesis (Aug-9 SEC spot-ADA-ETF eligibility milestone, 4 days out + ~70% whale accumulation + trendline breakout) intact — no invalidating news. **No action.**

No other positions (1 total: ADA). USDT $26.1996 (locked $0), ADA 35.1 (locked $0) — no resting orders (`orders` endpoint still HTTP 400 permission gap). 3/25 trades this week, 0/5 today. 1 closed trade this week (1W/0L) → circuit breaker N/A (needs ≥5 closed), daily gate N/A (0 trades today).

**Watchlist re-check (BNB, today's only RESEARCH-LOG watchlist ticker):**
- BNB $599.21, **+0.0101%** (vol $13.76M) — still flat, well below the +2% gate and the $605 reclaim trigger. **FAIL.**
- Perplexity key unset → WebSearch fallback: no fresh same-day liquid catalyst found; general "top altcoins" content only (Chainlink, Solana, Hyperliquid, Sui, Stellar) plus one outlet noting ADA's own triangle breakout toward $0.195 — already the held position, not a new-entry idea.

**Decision: NO NEW ENTRY.** BNB flat, fails gate; no fresh catalyst on any other name. Hold ADA (+1.83%, healthy, stop $0.1822), $26.1996 (79.6%) dry powder. No ClickUp alert (no trade fired, no state change from the earlier afternoon-execution run today). Re-evaluate at evening-scan.

## 2026-08-05 — Afternoon Execution Re-Check #2 (Ad Hoc, post-EOD)

**Reachability gate PASS:** `price BTCUSDT` = $64,740.94.

**ADA position:** Entry $0.18639 → live bid $0.1909/ask $0.1910, **+2.42%** (bid-basis). No cut (−7% = $0.1733, not close). No take-profit (+7% flag $0.1994 / +12% target $0.2088, not close). No tighten: +2.42% below the +3% trailing trigger and below the Aug-4 $0.1959 high that set the existing $0.1822 stop — retightening would move it down, prohibited. Thesis (Aug-9 SEC spot-ADA-ETF eligibility milestone, 4 days out + ~70% whale accumulation + trendline breakout) intact — no invalidating news. **No action.**

No other positions (1 total: ADA). USDT $26.1996 (locked $0), ADA 35.1 (locked $0) — no resting orders (`orders` endpoint still HTTP 400 permission gap). 3/25 trades this week, 0/5 today. 1 closed trade this week (1W/0L) → circuit breaker N/A (needs ≥5 closed), daily gate N/A (0 trades today).

**Watchlist re-check (BNB, today's only RESEARCH-LOG watchlist ticker):**
- BNB $-, +0.0032% (vol $14.1M) — still flat, well below the +2% gate and the $605 reclaim trigger. **FAIL.**
- Perplexity key unset → WebSearch fallback surfaced PUMP/HYPE as generic-listicle "top gainers" (12%/4% off-exchange), but live MEXC 24hr data shows both flat and thin: HYPE +0.03% (vol $1.63M), PUMP −0.02% (vol $0.53M) — well below both the +2% gate and the ~$3M liquidity threshold. **Disqualified — liquidity/quality filter.**

**Decision: NO NEW ENTRY.** BNB flat, fails gate; PUMP/HYPE disqualified on liquidity. Hold ADA (+2.42%, healthy, stop $0.1822), $26.1996 (79.6%) dry powder. No ClickUp alert (no trade fired, no state change from earlier runs today). Re-evaluate at evening-scan.

## 2026-08-06 — Trade Exit (daily-summary take-profit)
**SELL** ADAUSDT | Qty: 35.1 | Exit: ~$0.2110 avg (market, bid $0.2111) | Entry: $0.18639 | Realized P&L: +$0.84 (+12.9%) | Reason: +12% take-profit rule (no exceptions)
**OrderId:** C02__714089952823910401046
**Notes:** ADA ripped into the Aug-9 SEC spot-ADA-ETF eligibility milestone (3 days out) — Aug-5 EOD $0.1914 → this run bid $0.2111 (**+13.26% vs entry**), tripping the +12% target ($0.2088) decisively for the first time. Rulebook rule 6 / sell-side "P&L ≥ +12%: market sell immediately — no exceptions" fired; next routine (evening-scan) hours away and ADA volatile → executed at daily-summary. Closed via `mexc.sh close ADAUSDT`. No on-exchange stop to cancel (virtual/monitored $0.1822; USDT+ADA both locked=0 confirmed). USDT free $26.1996 → **$33.5845** (net proceeds $7.3849 vs $6.5424 cost basis). Portfolio now **100% cash, 0 open positions**. Thesis (Aug-9 ETF-eligibility + ~70% whale accumulation + trendline breakout + PV11 upgrade) played out in full — 2nd realized win of the phase. This week (Mon Aug 3–): 1 closed trade (win); phase closed record 2W/0L (ADA +7.0% Aug 1, ADA +12.9% Aug 6). Daily win rate 100% (1/1). ClickUp alerted.

## Aug 6 — EOD Snapshot (Day 15, Thursday)

**Portfolio:** $33.58 | **Cash:** $33.58 (100%) | **Day P&L:** +$0.66 (+2.02%) | **Phase P&L:** +$1.26 (+3.91%)

| Ticker | Qty | Entry | Price | Day Chg | Unrealized P&L | Stop |
|--------|-----|-------|-------|---------|----------------|------|
| — (100% cash) | — | — | — | — | — | — |

**Notes:** Best day of the phase — ADA take-profit executed at +12.9% ($0.18639 → ~$0.2110 avg, +$0.84 realized) when the price tripped the +12% target ($0.2088) into the Aug-9 SEC spot-ADA-ETF eligibility milestone (3 days out). Full cycle Aug 2 re-entry → Aug 6 target; thesis (ETF-eligibility + ~70% whale accumulation + trendline breakout + PV11 upgrade) played out exactly as planned. Portfolio now 100% cash: USDT free $33.5845 / locked $0 (canTrade=true), 0 positions, 0 open orders. Reachability gate PASS (BTC $64,718.31; ADA last $0.2112 / bid $0.2111). **Trades:** 1 today (the ADA exit, a win → daily win rate 100%); this week (Mon Aug 3–) 1 closed trade (1W/0L) → circuit breaker N/A (needs ≥5 closed), daily gate N/A (needs ≥5 trades). Day P&L +$0.66 = ADA realized appreciation (Aug 5 EOD $32.92 → $33.5845). Phase P&L +$1.26 (+3.91%) vs $32.32 baseline — new phase high (up from Aug 5's +$0.60), driven by the second ADA win. Deployment 0% vs 75-85% target — fully in cash post-exit, holding dry powder through tomorrow's Fri Aug-7 US NFP print (the week's primary binary catalyst); do not force a re-entry into an Extreme-Fear (F&G 25), pre-NFP, directionless tape. Note: eligibility ≠ approval (SEC ADA-ETF decision to ~Oct 23) — took the +12% money into the milestone rather than hold through headline whipsaw risk. **BTC buy-and-hold benchmark:** phase baseline BTC ~$63,500 (Jul 22 funding) → $64,718 now (~+1.9%); bot +3.91% phase — outperforming buy-and-hold by ~2 pts. Phase closed record now 2W/0L (ADA +7.0% Aug 1, ADA +12.9% Aug 6).

## 2026-08-07 — Midday Scan

**Reachability gate PASS:** `price BTCUSDT` = $64,964.99.

**Positions:** 0 open (100% cash). USDT free $33.5845 / locked $0 (canTrade=true). No resting orders. Nothing to cut (-7%), nothing to tighten (+15%/+20%), no thesis to re-check — no positions held since the Aug-6 ADA take-profit exit.

**Decision: NO ACTION.** No ClickUp alert (no action taken, no positions to report).

---

## 2026-08-07 — Afternoon Execution (Day 16, Friday, US market open)

**Reachability gate PASS:** `price BTCUSDT` = $65,262.49.

**Positions:** 0 open (100% cash). USDT free $33.5845 / locked $0 (canTrade=true). `orders` endpoint returns HTTP 400 (known permission-gap pattern) — both balances `locked: 0` confirms no resting orders. Nothing to cut, nothing to tighten, no take-profit — no positions held since the Aug-6 ADA exit. Trades this week 3/25, today 0/5. 1 closed trade this week (1W, ADA +12.9% Aug 6) → weekly circuit breaker N/A (needs ≥5 closed), daily gate N/A (0 trades today).

**Watchlist re-check (today's RESEARCH-LOG "Trade Ideas"/"Signal Confluence" — ADA primary, SKYAI secondary/pullback-only):**
- **ADA $0.2007, 24h +0.05%** ($12.0M vol) — momentum fully decelerated from this morning's +5-7%; flat, fails the ≥+2% entry gate outright. 3-Candle Confirmation Gate has now failed 3 consecutive scans (morning-execution, midday, now) — stalled sideways at $0.20, no fresh breakout.
- **SKYAI $0.1079, 24h +0.34%** ($4.67M vol) — decelerated from the +57% intraday spike to flat; well below the +2% gate, no pullback-support setup confirmed either. Stays disqualified/pullback-watch only.
- **Full board scan** (`/ticker/24hr`, all USDT pairs, chg ≥ +5% AND vol ≥ $3M): **zero qualifiers.** No liquid name clears Option A.
- **Perplexity afternoon catalyst check:** sources cite ADA "+7%" but those are stale/earlier-session snapshots contradicted by live MEXC data (ADA now flat +0.05%); no fresh same-day catalyst on any liquid name. No Option B/C override candidate found.

**Decision: NO NEW ENTRY.** Both watchlist names and the full liquid board fail the momentum gate live; no fresh catalyst. Preserve $33.5845 (100%) dry powder. No ClickUp alert (no trade fired, no state change). Re-evaluate at evening-scan.

**Notes:** Flat, no-trade day — held 100% cash through all four scan windows (morning-execution, midday, afternoon-execution, now EOD). USDT free $33.5844686955 / locked $0 (canTrade=true); 0 positions, 0 open orders (`orders` endpoint HTTP 400 known permission gap; balance locked=0 confirms no resting orders). Reachability gate PASS (BTC $65,021.89). **Trades:** 0 today, 3/25 this week; 1 closed trade this week (1W/0L, ADA +12.9% Aug 6) → circuit breaker N/A (needs ≥5 closed), daily gate N/A (0 trades today). Phase closed record 2W/0L. **Day P&L $0.00** — portfolio unchanged Aug-6 EOD $33.5845 → $33.5845 (100% cash both days, no fills today). **Phase P&L +$1.26 (+3.91%)** vs $32.32 baseline — held at Aug-6's phase high. Deployment 0% vs 75-85% target — disciplined cash hold: the only two liquid names clearing OPTION A were ADA (just-banked +12.9% winner, stalled sideways at $0.20, failed the 3-Candle Confirmation Gate at all four scans — volumes not rising, buy-the-rumor tail 2 days before the Aug-9 SEC spot-ADA-ETF eligibility milestone where eligibility ≠ approval) and SKYAI (parabolic +18-28% blow-off, disqualified as a chase); no rules-clean qualifier appeared, and F&G 29 (Fear) + coiled $64-65k BTC channel + NFP-day chop argued for capital preservation over a forced entry. **BTC buy-and-hold benchmark:** phase baseline BTC ~$63,500 (Jul 22 funding) → $65,021.89 now (~+2.40%); bot +3.91% phase — still outperforming buy-and-hold by ~1.5 pts. ADA remains PRIMARY re-entry candidate into Aug-9 *only* on a volume-confirmed 3-candle breakout holding ≥ $0.20 / ≥ +5%; otherwise stay cash. Re-evaluate at evening-scan.

## 2026-08-08 — Evening Scan (Day 17, Saturday, Asian open)

**Reachability gate PASS:** `price BTCUSDT` = $64,888.40.

**Positions:** 0 open (100% cash). USDT free $33.5844686955 / locked $0 (canTrade=true). No positions to protect — no emergency stop / take-profit checks apply (nothing held since Aug-6 ADA exit). Trades 3/25 wk, 0/5 today; 1 closed trade this week (1W, ADA +12.9% Aug 6) → weekly circuit breaker N/A (needs ≥5 closed), daily gate N/A (0 trades today).

**Overnight scan:** BTC +0.92% ($64.9k, coiled). F&G 30 (Fear). Live MEXC full-board OPTION-A scan → 2 qualifiers, both disqualified: **EPIC +24.55%** ($3.41M) parabolic blow-off, fails 3-candle gate, no coin-specific catalyst (thin-liquidity technical pop); **SKYAI +10.06%** ($3.69M) stalled ~$0.113, fails 3-candle gate, re-accelerated above its pullback-buy zone → chase. ADA $0.2003 (−0.59%) — momentum decayed, fails gate outright. Catalysts: NFP −23k (dovish, Fed hold), BTC ETF +$244M inflows (3-day $626M), Senate delayed Clarity Act, minor hacks (Zeus/Grinex), XRPL 3.3.0 pending validator approval — none tradeable.

**Decision: NO NEW ENTRY.** Both liquid qualifiers disqualified (parabolic/thin, fail 3-candle gate); ADA fails momentum gate. Preserve $33.5845 (100%) dry powder. ADA remains PRIMARY execution-validated re-entry into tomorrow's Aug-9 SEC spot-ADA-ETF eligibility milestone *only* on a volume-confirmed 3-candle breakout ≥ $0.20 / ≥ +5%; otherwise stay cash.

## 2026-08-08 — Morning Execution (Day 17, Saturday)

**Reachability gate PASS:** `price BTCUSDT` = $64,986.33.

**Account:** $33.5844686955 USDT free / locked $0 (canTrade=true). **0 positions, 100% cash** — nothing to protect (no cut/take-profit/tighten checks apply; nothing held since the Aug-6 ADA exit). Trades 3/25 wk · 0/5 today · 1 closed trade this week (1W/0L, ADA +12.9% Aug 6) → weekly circuit breaker N/A (needs ≥5 closed), daily gate N/A (0 trades today). Macro gate MACRO_SCORE ≈50 → SIZE_MULTIPLIER 0.6 (reduced, not halted); MACRO<60 ⇒ needs SCORE ≥8 OR OPTION_B.

**Trade-idea validation vs buy-side rules (live at execution):**
1. **ADA — PRIMARY conditional re-entry: FAIL.** Live ADA $0.2005, **−0.54% 24h** (H $0.204 / L $0.1966, vol $4.53M) — momentum decayed further from research's +0.75%. Re-entry required a volume-confirmed 3-candle breakout holding ≥ $0.20 / ≥ +5%; live print is flat-to-negative, no breakout. **3-Candle Gate FAIL, momentum gate FAIL → no entry.**
2. **EPIC — full-board sole OPTION-A qualifier: SKIP.** +31.27% ($3.89M) clears raw momentum+vol, but decaying from this morning's +42% (parabolic blow-off), ~$0.03M/hr thin liquidity, no coin-specific catalyst (Epic Cash vs Epic Chain conflation). **Fails 3-Candle Gate; Layer 3 exit-liquidity/bear-case = SKIP. Disqualified — chase into a fading microcap.**
3. **SKYAI — SECONDARY pullback-only: FAIL.** Live $0.10635, decayed below the +5% gate (off the qualifier list); not a pullback setup. Disqualified.
4. **Watchlist ETH $1,917 (~+0.6%) / BNB $593.43 (below $605 trigger):** neither trigger present.

Full-board OPTION-A scan (chg ≥ +5% AND quoteVol ≥ $3M): **1 raw qualifier (EPIC), disqualified on quality/gate.** No liquid rules-clean setup.

**Decision: NO NEW ENTRY — no trade fires.** No candidate passes the buy-side gate (ADA momentum decayed / no breakout; EPIC parabolic-thin fails 3-candle + Layer 3; SKYAI below gate; ETH/BNB no trigger). Preserve $33.58 (100%) dry powder into a Fear-tape (F&G 30), coiled $64–65k BTC channel, weekend. ADA stays PRIMARY execution-validated re-entry into tomorrow's Aug-9 eligibility milestone *only* on a volume-confirmed 3-candle breakout ≥ $0.20 / ≥ +5%. No ClickUp alert (no trade fired, no state change). Re-evaluate at next scan window.

**Reachability gate PASS:** `price BTCUSDT` = $64,960.23.

**Positions:** 0 open (100% cash). USDT free $33.5844686955 / locked $0 (canTrade=true) — confirmed live. No positions to protect — no emergency stop / take-profit checks apply (nothing held since Aug-6 ADA exit).

**Overnight scan:** BTC flat +0.24% (~$65k, coiled). Alts firm: SOL +3.4%, XRP +2.0%, LINK +1.8% — no leadership breakout. F&G ~Fear. Catalysts (last 6h): BTC+ETH ETFs $1.1B best inflow week since April (BlackRock ~80%), CLARITY Act shelved to September (no near-term legislative catalyst), Coldcard firmware bug drained 1,816 BTC / 5,200 addrs, XRPL v3.3.0 into validator vote, Goldman Bitcoin Premium ETF filing — none tradeable. Live MEXC full-board OPTION-A scan (chg≥+5% AND quoteVol≥$3M) → **1 qualifier: TUT +178.16% on thin $3.37M vol** — parabolic pump/meme blow-off, no coin-specific fundamental, fails 3-Candle Gate + Layer 3 exit-liquidity → disqualified as a chase. CoinGecko trending (PENGU/TUT/PUMP/PEPE) = retail meme rotation, none rules-clean.

**ADA (PRIMARY Aug-9 re-entry candidate): FAIL.** Live $0.1989, **−0.69% 24h** (H $0.2023 / L $0.1978, vol $2.48M) — below $0.20, negative momentum, no volume-confirmed 3-candle breakout. Aug-9 SEC spot-ADA-ETF *eligibility* milestone ≠ approval; buy-the-rumor tail already faded. 3-Candle Gate FAIL, momentum gate FAIL → no entry.

**Decision: NO NEW ENTRY.** Sole OPTION-A qualifier (TUT) is a parabolic-thin meme chase; ADA fails momentum/breakout gate; no smart-money accumulation signal on a liquid name. Preserve $33.5845 (100%) dry powder into Fear tape + coiled $64–65k BTC channel. **Tomorrow's watchlist:** ADA (only on volume-confirmed 3-candle breakout ≥$0.20/≥+5%), SOL/XRP/LINK (watch for alt-leadership breakout with rising vol), BTC $65,300 resistance reclaim. No ClickUp alert (no trade fired, no state change from prior runs). Weekly-review also due (Sunday). Re-evaluate at next scan window.
