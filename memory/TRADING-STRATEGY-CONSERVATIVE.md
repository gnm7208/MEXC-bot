# Trading Strategy

## Mission
Outperform BTC buy-and-hold over the challenge window using active swing trades on
MEXC Spot. Spot only — no margin, no futures, no leverage, ever.

## Capital & Constraints
- Starting capital: variable (see TRADE-LOG for current equity)
- Platform: MEXC Spot
- Instruments: Spot crypto only (USDT pairs preferred)
- Market hours: 24/7 — but focus research during US morning (6-10 AM CT)

## Core Rules
1. SPOT ONLY — no margin, no futures, no leverage, ever
2. 75-85% deployed; hold 15-25% USDT as dry powder
3. 5-6 positions max; 20% of total portfolio per position
4. Every position gets a stop price recorded in TRADE-LOG immediately after fill (MEXC spot
   API does not support resting stop-limit orders — monitored stops enforce the same rule).
   Stop = entry price × 0.90 (-10%). Enforced at every midday and afternoon scan.
5. Cut losers at -7% from entry: market sell immediately when price ≤ stop level
6. Take profit at +7%: market sell immediately — no exceptions
7. Trailing stop (manual — enforced by monitoring routines):
   - Entry: stop at -10% below fill price (recorded in TRADE-LOG)
   - At +3% gain: tighten stop to 7% below current price (update TRADE-LOG)
   - At +7% gain: close for take profit
   - Never tighten within 3% of current price; never move a stop down
8. Max 25 new trades per week; max 5 new trades per day
9. Weekly circuit breaker: if ≥ 40% of this week's closed trades are losses (min 5 trades) → halt new entries; resume when F&G > 50 AND BTC 24h > 0%
10. Daily gate: if ≥ 5 trades placed today AND today's win rate < 60% → halt new entries until tomorrow
11. Momentum filter: only enter if 24h price change ≥ +2% OR a strong confirmed catalyst justifies entry against trend
12. Follow sector momentum (L1s, DeFi, AI/data layer, gaming/NFT, BTC dominance)
13. Exit a sector after 2 consecutive failed trades

## Entry Checklist (document ALL before placing order)
- Specific catalyst today?
- Sector in momentum?
- Stop level (7-10% below entry)?
- Target (minimum 2:1 R:R)?

## Buy-Side Gate (every check must pass)
- Weekly circuit breaker NOT active (< 40% loss rate on min 5 closed trades this week)
- Daily gate NOT active (if ≥ 5 trades today, today's win rate ≥ 60%)
- Total positions after fill ≤ 6
- Trades placed today + 1 ≤ 5
- Trades placed this week + 1 ≤ 25
- Position cost ≤ 20% of total portfolio USDT value
- Position cost ≤ available USDT balance
- Entry signal: EITHER a strong catalyst documented in today's RESEARCH-LOG (news event,
  protocol upgrade, whale accumulation, sector rotation) OR 24h price change ≥ +2% with
  no catalyst needed. Catalyst alone is sufficient — do not require both.
- Instrument is spot crypto (USDT pair on MEXC)

## Order Shapes
```bash
# Market buy (spend USDT amount)
bash scripts/mexc.sh order \
  '{"symbol":"BTCUSDT","side":"BUY","type":"MARKET","quoteOrderQty":"2000"}'

# Take-profit / cut loser (market sell full position)
bash scripts/mexc.sh close BTCUSDT

# NOTE: MEXC spot API only supports LIMIT, MARKET, LIMIT_MAKER — no STOP_LOSS_LIMIT.
# Stops are enforced by monitoring routines (midday + afternoon scans).
# After every buy, record in TRADE-LOG: entry price, stop price (-10%), target (+7%).
```

## Sell-Side Rules (evaluated at EVERY midday and afternoon scan)

- Unrealized loss ≤ -7% OR price ≤ stop price in TRADE-LOG: market sell immediately
- Up +7% or more: market sell immediately — take profit
- Up +3% to +6%: update stop in TRADE-LOG to 7% below current price (trailing adjustment)
- Thesis broken (catalyst invalidated, sector rolling over): market sell even if not at -7%
- Sector has 2 consecutive failed trades: exit all positions in that sector

## Research Priorities (morning-research workflow)
- BTC price and dominance
- Crypto market sentiment (Fear & Greed Index)
- Top performing sectors this week
- Macro: DXY, Fed policy, rate expectations, risk-on/risk-off
- On-chain: exchange inflows/outflows, funding rates, open interest
- News on held tokens
- 2-3 actionable trade ideas with full entry/stop/target

## Notes from Experience
(Updated weekly; see WEEKLY-REVIEW.md for context)
- Week 1 (ending 2026-07-19): 0 trades. Grade F. Root cause operational — Binance = HTTP 451
  geo-block; Bybit = CloudFront 403 same issue; resolved by migrating to MEXC (no cloud IP
  block, 0% maker fees). Now trading live on MEXC Spot.
- **Reachability gate:** every run must first confirm the exchange API responds
  (`bash scripts/mexc.sh price BTCUSDT`). If it fails, HALT, alert, and place no orders —
  do not migrate exchanges again without verifying the new venue is reachable from this IP.
- **Stop mechanism (resolved 2026-07-27):** MEXC spot API only supports LIMIT, MARKET,
  LIMIT_MAKER — no STOP_LOSS_LIMIT. Rule 4 updated: record stop price in TRADE-LOG at entry;
  midday and afternoon-execution routines enforce the -7% cut via market sell. This is the
  live stop mechanism — do NOT skip trades because of missing stop-limit orders.

### AGGRESSIVE MODE phase results (Jul 22 – Aug 22, 2026) — reverted here 2026-08-26
Ran under memory/TRADING-STRATEGY.md's AGGRESSIVE MODE ruleset (higher size %, wider
stops/targets, virtual capital sizing, Rule 12 BTC-core). Phase P&L +10.67% vs BTC ~+21.4%
(bot trailed by ~10.7 pts). Closed record 3W/0L. Carried forward as this file becomes the
live rulebook again:
- **Alt-entry gate strictness — validated, kept as-is.** Only 2 alt round-trips closed all
  phase (both ADA, both wins, +7.0% / +12.9%), but every rejected candidate that was checked
  was a genuine disqualifier (thin/spent pump, no exit liquidity, downtrend bounce). The
  quality bar was correct for a persistent Fear-tape regime — do not loosen this file's
  equivalent momentum/catalyst gate to force more trade volume.
  This file does not include the aggressive-mode signal-scoring system (0-20 pts) or the
  Rule-12 BTC benchmark-tracking core — both are aggressive-mode-only mechanics and were not
  carried into this revert. If a future aggressive phase reintroduces a BTC-core carveout,
  size it above the ~30-40% cap used here: this phase's worst benchmark miss (Week 6,
  −14.74 pts) came from that cap, not from bad timing — a correctly-timed core still can't
  track a >20%-in-a-week BTC move at 35% weight.
- **Signal-scoring system was never validated.** In 3 weeks of existence it produced zero
  live trades — every scan that reached scoring was disqualified upstream (3-Candle Gate,
  EMA-200, liquidity floor) before a score-based entry ever fired.
- **Operational reliability, not strategy design, was the binding constraint in the phase's
  final week.** A 3-day scheduler/cron gap (Aug 19 night – Aug 22, MEXC-bot-specific — sibling
  `alpaca/` routines kept firing) meant the bot traded blind through BTC's sharpest rally of
  the challenge. Confirm the routine schedule is healthy before trusting any read of strategy
  performance during a gap period.
