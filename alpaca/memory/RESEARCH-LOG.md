### BLOCKED — Missing Credentials

`ALPACA_API_KEY_ID` and `ALPACA_API_SECRET_KEY` not set in environment.
`scripts/alpaca.sh account` failed: `ALPACA_API_KEY_ID not set in environment`.

Cannot fetch account, positions, movers, quotes, or bars. Research skipped
in full — no candidates scanned, no trades evaluated.

CLICKUP_API_KEY and PERPLEXITY_API_KEY were present and working; issue is
isolated to Alpaca credentials on this cloud routine.

Notified via ClickUp. Needs env var fix on the cloud runner config before
the next scheduled run (morning-execution, midday, eod-scan will also fail).

### Decision
CIRCUIT_BREAKER (credentials unavailable, not a trading halt)
